## Overview

This repository contains code, analysis, and datasets demonstrating how to access and work with NASA's climate data. It explores practical applications of satellite-derived climate data in real-world scenarios, including architectural design, food security, and climate impact assessment.

This is **Part 1** of a comprehensive guide to leveraging NASA's publicly available climate datasets for climate research and climate action.
